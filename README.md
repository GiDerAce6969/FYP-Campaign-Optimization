# How It Works?
For this project, it is basically use machine learning to retrieve data / simulate data for training AI to capture the pattern of customer flow.
SHAP analysis is used to determine the contribution of each factor so that it is easy to understand which factor affect the most on the efficiency of customer flow management.
